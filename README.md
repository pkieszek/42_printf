🖨️ printf

Reimplementing the standard printf function from scratch!

This project is part of the 42 curriculum, challenging me to understand variadic functions, format specifiers, and memory management in C. The goal was to create a simplified version of printf that handles various conversions such as characters, strings, integers, unsigned numbers, hexadecimal, and pointers, all while efficiently managing output formatting.

🔹 Key concepts learned:
	•	Variadic functions (va_list, va_start, va_arg, va_end)
	•	Handling format specifiers (%c, %s, %d, %x, etc.)
	•	Memory and buffer management
	•	Writing modular and efficient C code

This project reinforced my understanding of low-level programming and helped me appreciate how much work goes into seemingly simple functions. 🚀
